# 🕵️ Stealth Health AI Agent

An AI-powered wellness coaching assistant that personalizes health guidance through structured patient onboarding, adaptive daily check-ins, session memory, and protocol-grounded responses.

## 🚀 Overview

Stealth Health AI Agent is designed to simulate a personalized health coach. The system extracts structured patient information from unstructured onboarding text, adapts its behavior based on the user's protocol day, remembers previous interactions within a session, and answers wellness-related questions using a predefined protocol.

An AI-powered wellness coaching assistant that personalizes health guidance through structured patient onboarding, adaptive daily check-ins, session memory, and protocol-grounded responses.


## ✨ Features

### 1. Patient Onboarding Extraction

The agent converts unstructured onboarding text into a structured patient profile.

**Input Example**

```text
I am Guewst, 22 years old.
My goal is improving sleep.
I currently sleep 5 hours.
Put me on Day 5.
```

**Extracted Profile**

```json
{
  "name": "Guest",
  "age": 22,
  "primary_goal": "improving sleep",
  "sleep_hours": 5,
  "current_day": 5
}
```

---

### 2. Adaptive Daily Check-ins

The agent dynamically changes its coaching style based on protocol progression.

**Day 1**

* Welcome and introduction
* Goal review
* Habit baseline assessment

**Day 2–4**

* Progress tracking
* Habit consistency checks
* Accountability questions

**Day 5+**

* Goal-focused follow-up
* Barrier identification
* Long-term consistency coaching

---

### 3. Session Memory

The agent remembers previous user messages during the active session and can reference earlier check-ins for a more personalized experience.

---

### 4. Protocol-Grounded Responses

The assistant is restricted to answering questions using the provided wellness protocol.

If information is not present in the protocol, the agent responds:

```text
I couldn't find that in the protocol document.
```

This minimizes hallucinations and ensures reliable responses.
